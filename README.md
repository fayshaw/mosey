# MOSEY

This project is about local data for pedestrian and cyclist safety in the City of Malden. 
It pulls data from the <a href="https://apps.crashdata.dot.mass.gov/cdp/home">Massachsetts Department of Transportation Crash Portal</a>
and <a href-"http://walkscore.com">Walk Score</a>. 


particularly the City of Malden.  Here, and throughout the US, there are far too many 
car crashes and I saw pedestrian fatalities on the rise near my home. As a concerned 
citizen and as a data scientist, I have been motivated to better understand street safety. 

This project explores walkability by examining car crashes in recent years.  The user enters an address and a bounding box is created using latitude and longitude to show proximal car accidents. The MOSEY score is a measure of safety that is inversely correlated with the number of car crashes in the area.
