# MOSEY: Move on Safely EverYone

## Overview
To better understand the dangers of road safety, this project visualizes car crashes involving pedestrians 
in the City of Malden, Massachusetts.  Here, and throughout the US, there are far too 
many car crashes and pedestrian and cyclist fatalities.  

## Features
In this webapp, the user enters an address and a bounding box is created using latitude and longitude 
to show proximal car accidents.  

## Data Sources
This project pulls data from the <a href="https://apps.crashdata.dot.mass.gov/cdp/home">Massachsetts 
Department of Transportation Crash Portal</a> and <a href="http://walkscore.com">Walk Score</a>.
