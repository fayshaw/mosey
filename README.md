# MOSEY

This project explores walkability by examining car crashes in recent years.  The user enters an address and a bounding box is created using latitude and longitude to show proximal car accidents. The MOSEY score is a measure of safety that is inversely correlated with the number of car crashes in the area.  

This project is inspired by Walk Score (walkscore.com).
